# Image-to-ASCII

A simple project to start messing around with files and images. I found the SMFL library and turns out it's pretty easy to use. The code is public, so everyone can play around with it.

Have fun!


## Usage

From a terminal, inside the folder containing the executable, run the following command:

	./ImgToASCII photoPath
	
And your ASCII image will be printed in the terminal.
